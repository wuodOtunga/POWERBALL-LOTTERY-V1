# Foundational Projects ðŸ§±

A collection of Solidity projects Iâ€™ve built while learning and practicing Ethereum smart contract development.  
This repository documents my journey as a Solidity student, from simple contracts to more complex DeFi building blocks.  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Purpose
The goal of this repo is to:
1. Practice writing clean and secure Solidity code.  
2. Document foundational smart contract patterns and principles.  
3. Build a reference library I can revisit as I progress to advanced projects and audits.
